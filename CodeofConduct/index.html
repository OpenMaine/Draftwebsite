          <p>Note: As a chapter of Code for America, our Code of Conduct is revised from their <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

          <p>OpenMaine events strive to be as inclusive as possible. If you feel that our environment is unwelcoming or exclusionary, we invite your <a href="mailto:hello@openmaine.org" target="_blank"> feedback</a>. You may also contact individual members of the leadership team at the email addresses at the bottom of this document.</p>

          <p>OpenMaine events do not operate in a historical or cultural vacuum. We recognize that spaces within the tech ecosystem have traditionally excluded women, POC, disabled, and queer communities. These guidelines are meant to promote a healthy and inviting atmosphere for all and especially for those who are traditionally excluded. Any form of discussion, either online or in-person, which seeks to trivialize or undermine the experience of traditionally marginalized groups will not be tolerated and is in violation of this Code of Conduct.</p>

          <p>The OpenMaine community expects that OpenMaine activities, events, and digital forums:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.</li>
            <li> Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.</li>
            <li>Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.</li>
            <li>Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.</li>
            <li>Do not place the burden of teaching or proving harassment on the harassed individuals.</li>
            <li>Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy. Use language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”</li>
            <li>Encourage members and participants to listen more than they speak.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.</li>
            <li>Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.</li>
            <li>Follow the Guiding Principles of OpenMaine.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>OpenMaine reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in OpenMaine activities, events, and digital forums.</p>

          <p>Code for America reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in Code for America network activities, events, and digital forums.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <hr />

      </div>

      <div class="row justify-content-md-center">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <p>(Based on Code For America’s Anti-Harassment Policy, which in turn is based on the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.)</p>

          <p>All OpenMaine network activities, events, and digital forums and their staff, presenters, and participants are held to an anti-harassment policy, included below.</p>

          <p>In addition to governing our own events by this policy, OpenMaine will only lend our brand and fund groups that offer an anti-harassment policy to their attendees. For information on how to offer an anti-harassment policy to your group, see this guide.</p>

          <p>OpenMaine is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of staff, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any OpenMaine event or network activity, including talks. Anyone in violation of these policies may be expelled from OpenMaine network activities, events, and digital forums, at the discretion of the event organizer or forum administrator.</p>

          <p>Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments. Those comments may be related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing language or action.</p>

          <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from OpenMaine activities, events, and digital forums. Violations of the Code of Conduct are recorded and reviewed by the leadership team.</p>

          <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the OpenMaine leadership team immediately in person or by email (see below). OpenMaine leaders will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.</p>

            Clare Congdon: clare at openmaine.org<br />
          </p>

          <p>If you cannot reach an OpenMaine leader and/or it is an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove yourself from the situation.</p>

          <p>You can also contact OpenMaine about harassment by emailing hello at openmaine.org and feel free to use the email template below. OpenMaine leaders acknowledge that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation due to the number of events and the fact that our team is not always present. However, we are hopeful that by providing these guidelines we are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an environment that is welcoming to all.</p>

          <p>We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.</p>
